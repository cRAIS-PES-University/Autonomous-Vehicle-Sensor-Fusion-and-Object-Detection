# Autonomous-Vehicle-Sensor-Fusion-and-Object-Detection
The internship focuses on integrating data from multiple sensors, such as LiDAR, cameras, and
radar, to improve the accuracy and reliability of obstacle detection systems. Interns need to
explore advanced algorithms, including deep learning models, for real-time object recognition and
tracking, contributing to the development of robust perception systems for autonomous vehicles.
